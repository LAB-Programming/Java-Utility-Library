This is a library in which we put utility classes that we feel java is missing

Currently in the library:
	-com.lab_programming.util.RegularTokenizer
		Description:
			Like the StringTokenizer class in java.util but can handle regular expressions
		Status:
			Bug-free and functional but there is still a bit of work to do
		Bugs: None known
		To do (prioritized):
			-Documentation
			-Add a countTokens() similar to StringTokenizer's
			-Make it iterable
