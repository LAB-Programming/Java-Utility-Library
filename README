This is a library in which we put utility classes that we feel java is missing

IMPORTANT: Do not push a library class or classes to the master branch until:
	   1. It has no bugs
	   2. It has no pending bug fixes
	   3. It has no important improvements
	   4. It MUST have documentation

Currently in the library:
	-com.lab_programming.util.RegularTokenizer
		Description:
			Like the StringTokenizer class in java.util but can handle regular expressions
		Status:
			Bug-free and functional but there is still a bit of work to do
		Bugs: None known
		To do (prioritized in each from most to least important):
			Required Bug Fixes: None
			Important Improvements:
				-Documentation
			Future Plans:
				-Allow it to be constructed from a pattern (or maybe even a matcher)
				-Make it extend StringTokenizer
				-Make it thread-safe
				-Make it iterable
